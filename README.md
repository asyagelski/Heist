# Heist
Another C++ Project I'll Probably Abandon

- Language: C++
- IDE: Visual Studio 2017
- Image Editor: Paint.net
- GIF Compiler: Pyxel Edit

### Current Assets
- Cop walking with swinging shoulders, no hat bob.
- Pixel dimensions are 38x38, image is scaled 2x to 76x76. Should probably change it to 2^n...
